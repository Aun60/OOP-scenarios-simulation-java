# Object-Oriented Programming Scenarios in Java

This repository contains five object-oriented programming scenarios implemented in Java. Each file corresponds to a unique problem designed to demonstrate key OOP principles like encapsulation, class interaction, constructors, and real-world modeling.

## 📂 Structure

Each question is implemented in its own `.java` source file:

- `Question1.java`
- `Question2.java`
- `Question3.java`
- `Question4.java`
- `Question5.java`

## 🧠 Questions Overview

### 🏠 Question 1: Smart Home Heating System (10 Marks)
Simulate a heating system using `Room` and `Radiator` classes:
- Radiator IDs based on student ID, incremented by 15
- Maximum 2 radiators per room
- Methods to link radiator and room objects

### 💬 Question 2: DataHub Q&A Platform (10 Marks)
Model a simple Q&A platform:
- `DataScientist` class tracks personal info, questions asked, answers given
- `Admin` class manages user count and personal details
- Unique IDs based on student ID digits

### ❤️ Question 3: Heart Rate Calculator (10 Marks)
Build a class `HeartRates` for personal health monitoring:
- Takes DOB and calculates age
- Computes maximum and target heart rates
- ID based on student ID digit

### 🎬 Question 4: Atrium Cinema Ticketing System (10 Marks)
Simulate movie ticket booking:
- `Movie` class stores showtime data
- `Ticket` class tracks ticket ID, seat, row, and sale status
- Ticket ID derived from student ID

### 👟 Question 5: Shoe Recommendation System (10 Marks + Bonus)
Recommend shoes based on user profile:
- `User` and `Shoe` classes store demographic info
- Auto-assign age category (infant, child, etc.)
- Menu-driven interface to update and view info
- Optional global function to display all data

## 🔧 How to Run

You can compile and run each Java file individually:

```bash
javac Question1.java
java Question1

Repeat for other files.


📌 Note
Student ID used for ID generation: 22K-1345

Modify the code if your ID is different.
